# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview

The objective of this project was to use Neural Networks to build a model that predicts which projects would be successful to invest in based on various project attributes. 

## Results
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- the target variable for this model was a binary column that indicated project success


What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- featurs for the model included afflilliation, classification, and use case



What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data
- ask amount and status were removed from the model 


*Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model*

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
-originally I started with three but slowy increased to six. this was done to try to improve the accuracy of the model 

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
-i was not able to increase the performance 

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
- i increased the layers, Epochs, and neurons

## Summary
As a result of this excesise i was able to build out a model with 53% accuracy in determining successful and non successful projects.
